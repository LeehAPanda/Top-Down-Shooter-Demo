## First Godot Project

- Using [Coding with Russ's tutorial](https://youtu.be/XwQhWTFRdHk?si=AQHW8RH_W56m5FMi), I was able to make a top down shooter that gets increasingly harder with each wave that passes.
- My only intention with this was to make a quick demo to familiarize myself with Godot and learning the basics of their scripting language.
- I learned how nodes work, how they can interact with each other, how scenes work, new ways of setting up animations, and how the engine holds things together easily for the developer.
- A different experience compared to making the engine from scratch as well as the game, but a pleasurable one that I will mostly likely return to in the future.
- There's a potential I return to this demo to continue experimenting with Godot on my own terms, such as adding more enemies, more items, sounds, and potentially new levels, but I will leave the project as is for now.
